## Overview

This course provides an introduction to the human-centered and technical workings behind interactive devices. In a studio environment, students develop low and high-fidelity interactive prototypes that can be deployed and experienced by real users. Lectures cover the history and principles of human-computer interaction, behavior prototyping, physical and graphical user interfaces, machine intelligence, neural networks, and large language models. Provides a foundation in technical skills, such as physical prototyping, coding, and electronics, as well as how to collect data, train and deploy your own neural network models.
